Teammates: Dev Aggarwal, Hrutvik Rao Palutla Venkata

We spent a lot of this project working together by pair programming, discussing design decisions, 
and debugging late into the night. Early on, we spent significant time planning how the supplemental 
page table, frame table, and swap system would interact before writing any major code.

We implemented the VM system by developing in small increments and then rigorously testing as we went. 
Much of our time was spent diagnosing tricky synchronization bugs, refining our eviction policy, and 
making sure page faults and stack growth worked seamlessly. When something broke, we’d usually hop 
on a call or meet up, walk through the flow step by step, and brainstorm fixes until it was stable.

Overall, each of us took on tasks as needed, reviewing each other’s changes, and constantly testing 
together. By the end, we had all components (supplemental page tables, frames, swap, and fault 
handling) working cleanly.

Total Hours Spent: ~16–18 hours each
